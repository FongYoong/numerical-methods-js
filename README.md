# Numerical Methods Web Demo

### ðŸŽ® [View the website here.](http://fongyoong.github.io/numerical-methods-js)

* A static React website which contains solvers for a couple of numerical topics and graph visualisations for certain topics.

* Due to time constraints, the code is mostly unoptimised and un-memoised at the moment.

* Maybe a PWA or Electron.js port soon? ðŸ¤”

***

## Development

* `npm start` to run the React site locally.

* `npm run analyze` to analyze the build size of the React site.
